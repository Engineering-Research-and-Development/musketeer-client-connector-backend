# connector-client-backend 

This repository contains a RESTful API to interact with a cloud target platform for federated machine learning. It is primarily targeted at algorithm developers who are planning to design and run federated machine learning algorithms through a graphical user interface. 

The graphical user interface (front-end component) it is available at "https://github.com/Engineering-Research-and-Development/musketeer-client-connector-frontend".

## Prerequisites

In order to run the application through a Docker container, a Docker installation is required in the host.
The Docker Daemon must be running to perform the following commands.

To enable the direct download of the Docker images created for the Muskeeter's end users,
you should log in to our registry using the following commands:

* `docker login gitlab.alidalab.it:5000/musketeer/connector-client-backend`
user and password: contact musketeer-team@eng.it

* `docker login gitlab.alidalab.it:5000/musketeer/ngx-musketeer-client`
user and password: contact musketeer-team@eng.it

  
## Installation

As a first step create the Docker image of the backend components. From the project root, run the following command through the terminal:  

    docker build -f Dockerfile -t MYBUILDIMAGE 

The same MYBUILDIMAGE name chosen must be inserted in the docker-compose.yml file.  

Before running the docker-compose.yml the user must also configure the Docker volumes for the backend component. In particular, it is necessary to specify: 

FS_PATH_DATA: a filesystem path directory where there are the datasets that you want to bind to the Client Connector. 

FS_PATH_LOGS: a filesystem path directory where to store all the logs file generated by the task you run. 

FS_PATH_RESULTS: a filesystem path directory where to store all the results file generated by the task you run and complete. 

The docker-compose.yml contains both the backend image just created and the frontend component. The frontend Docker image is located on a repository accessible through authentication to our Docker registry. 
To log in, run the following command: 

docker login gitlab.alidalab.it:5000/musketeer/ngx-musketeer-client, followed by USER and PASSWORD that have been provided by ENGINEERING. 

Finally, run the following command to run and up the Desktop Client Connector: 

    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up 

The frontend Docker image will be automatically pulled from the register, if it is not present. 
It may take some minutes to download all the required dependencies based on your internet connection. 
Once it is done, the local server will be running at '127.0.0.1:5000', whilst you can use the User Interface by opening a browser and writing the following URL: '127.0.0.1:4500' (or 'localhost:4500').
